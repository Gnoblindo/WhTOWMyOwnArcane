<h3>Immortulz</h3>
 A unit with this rule gives a +1 CR modifier in Combat (not cumulative) and at the end of each turn such unit revives all of its lost models, but with special conditions*. A character with this rule regains one wound after overkilling a character in challenge by at least 1 wound.
<br><b>*Conditions of revival</b><ul>
  <li>You must have never Fell Back in Good Order or Fled and your General is alive. You must not have lost the Blasted Banner.</li>
  <li>If you lost 25% of models or more in one turn, that quarter can't be revived.</li>
  <li>When getting below Half Strength that half can't be revived.</li>
  <li>When being 25% or less of starting models, you can revive no more.</li>
  <li>Each time you revive, you can revive 1 model less.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Marching 'Ardboyz</h3>
All Black Orc Mobs have this rule. Orc Mobs can purchase it for +1 pts per model.<br>
This is a special formation. It looks like Close or Open Order, but always counts as in Marching Column(and has no ranks). For it Difficult Terrain counts as Dangerous and Dangerous as Impossible. Gives +1 to armour against shooting of models in it. Can choose to change to Close Order when declaring a charge.
<h3>Grimgor's Bestests</h3>
This Army's General is constantly caster of Ere We Go spell. It is remains in play and may not be dispelled by <b>ANY</b> means.

<h3>Snotlings & Snotlings</h3>
Your army may include special Snotling Units, Characters and Special Shrooms for Snottlings, which are allowed only in this army of infamy.
<h3>Swarming Snotling Masses</h3>
Before counting CR for combats with any Snotling unit with more than 1 US, count US of all enemy models in base contact with you(excluding enemy Swarms) and roll that many dices. For each 4+ you gain 1 Wound, which can be saved by Armour. This represents Snotlings swarming and pushing themselves under enemies. However your Herds always have Fighting Rank by 1 rank longer, and Swarms can Pile On enemies.
<h3>Piling On</h3>
Snotling Swarms can Pile On in combat. For each wound dealt to you or the enemy, you gain 1 Stack. For Giving Ground(by any side) you gain 3 Stacks. That means, for each Stack, you may attack 1 additional attack from a single Snotling Swarm, and loose those attacks from rear Swarms. Also all the Swarms not in Fighting Rank, temporarily disappear from combat(they provide attacks for Stacks, but Pile Up on Fighting Swarms into 1 Base).

-Handler&Beast: Skarsnik is the named character (Night Goblin Warboss) and Gobbla is a normal model always in unit with<br>him. When not in a unit, they count as a skirmish unit of two.

<br>-Mork's Cunning: Skarsnik has Access to special Traps & Strategies. Some of them are passive, abilities activated as shooting or<br>at Start of Battle:<br><br>

It will be Disrupted till<br>your next Start of Turn sub-phase if It does not pass an Initiative test. If It was in a skirmish formation, place a small template<br>on center of that unit<br>and scatter by D6(hit means no scatter). Any model under It risks being hit by a St 4 AP -1 attack.<br>
<br>•Ambush Trap - Before Battle. Randomly select x enemy units. x is 1 per 1000pts +1. They roll a D6. On 4+ they start the Battle<br>in Ambush.<br><br>
•Cunny-Trap - Passive. Each time when an enemy unit Breakes & Flee, because of any Night Goblin Unit won a CR with them,<br>You May roll a D6. On 1-3 that Night Goblin unit suffers D3+1 wounds. On 4+ the Broken unit Flees D3 inches less.<br>

<h3>Squigification table</h3>
Making Squigs(by Bone-wood Staff or Prophet rule) creates squigs depending on model transformed. If you transform your Wizard by Prophet, he may join a corresponding unit with such squigs(if you have one. In other case he is lost). Squigs of Bone-wood Staff are loose, ignoring unit coherency and Stupidity:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Monsters and Heavy Chariots -> 5 times multiplied whatever else they match for</li>
  <li>Light Chariots -> 3 times multiplied whatever else they match for</li>
  <li>Swarms without Fly rule -> Squiglings</li>
  <li>Swarms with Fly rule -> Bat Squigs</li>
  <li>Others with Fly rule -> Big Flappas</li>
  <li>Left Monstrous or Behemoths that never used Ranged Weapon -> Horned Squigs</li>
  <li>Left Monstrous or Behemoths that have used Ranged Weapon -> Spiked Squigs</li>
