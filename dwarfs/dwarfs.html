<ul>
  <li>Cannon: Now not only targets on the line of Fire are hit, but you Swipe the 3" template with that line. All under it risk being hit. Those attacks have 10Strength, no Armour Saves allowed and deal Multiple Wounds(D3+1). Now it has Range of 200" and moves through Terrain and Monsters.</li>
  <li>Bolt Thrower: Improves range to 68". Now no Armour or Regeneration Saves are allowed against this weapon and with each shot you roll an Artillery Die. Its result adds that much Strength to a normal 4 of this weapon. It now ignores cover, long range, gains +1 to Hit and deals Multiple Wounds(D3 +2).</li>
  <li>Stone Thrower: Now shoots 5" template, Deals Multiple Wounds(D6 +1) on direct Hit, Has Strength 5(10) and no Armour Saves are allowed against it(on center. Outside it normal AP applies). It scatters by 2" less always.</li>

Each Command Phase you look at the number that was rolled, and on the Crew number of this Machine. If the Shake number was Higher, you may not shoot this turn, and lose 1 Crew Wound. You then remove the Shake.<br>

  <h3>Range Focus</h3>
  This unit loses Quick Shoot but gains +4" of range to its weapons.<br>
  This Aircraft's Hull runes do not count to Engineer's magic item points cap(including this rune), but Engineer loses also 1 Wound(2 if riding Battle Barge).<br><br><br>
  <h3>Pistol Duelist</h3>
  Instead of Slayer ability, these Slayers are good at shooting. Their Strength still improves to 4 if attacking in Combat someone with Toughness<br>of 4 or more. They may shoot their Brace of Pistols in the shooting phase even if they are in Combat, but it causes -1 to Hit modifier and they<br>must shoot at unit they are engaged with. Also they can immediately shoot back to unit that shoots at them, if range allows them to do so.
  <h3>Experimental Shotgun</h3>
  Special Weapons with following profile:<br>

</tr>
</table><br>
<b>Note that:</b> This weapon makes an Artillery Dice of Multiple Shoots, however Missfire causes D3 Wounds to this unit(with Ward Saves permitted)<br>
